# bci-gpt-inverse-sim
The bci-gpt-inverse-sim implements a synthetic-to-real simulator that maps imagined speech EEG signals to language model token logits. Using GAN-based inverse mapping and the latest advances in BCI-LLM fusion (2025), it enables direct thought-to-text communication with unprecedented accuracy.
