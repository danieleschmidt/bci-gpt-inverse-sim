# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status
Template

## Context
We need a consistent format for documenting important architectural decisions in the BCI-GPT project.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions, following the format outlined by Michael Nygard.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Decisions are documented with context and rationale
- New team members can understand historical decisions
- Decision review process becomes standardized
- Knowledge retention across team changes

### Negative
- Additional overhead for decision documentation
- Risk of ADRs becoming outdated if not maintained
