# ADR-0002: PyTorch Framework Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The BCI-GPT system requires a deep learning framework for implementing neural networks for EEG processing, language modeling, and inverse synthesis. Key requirements include:

- Strong support for transformer architectures
- CUDA acceleration for real-time inference
- Research-friendly APIs for experimentation
- Production deployment capabilities
- Active community and ecosystem

Primary alternatives considered:
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow/Keras
- JAX/Flax

## Decision
We will use PyTorch as the primary deep learning framework for the BCI-GPT system.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Excellent transformer ecosystem through HuggingFace
- Dynamic computation graphs enable flexible model architectures
- Strong research community adoption
- Native CUDA support with efficient memory management
- Comprehensive tooling for model optimization (TorchScript, quantization)
- Seamless integration with neuroimaging libraries (MNE-Python)

### Negative
- Less mature production deployment tools compared to TensorFlow Serving
- Higher memory usage in some scenarios
- Learning curve for team members familiar with TensorFlow

## Implementation Notes
- Use HuggingFace Transformers for language model components
- Leverage PyTorch Lightning for training infrastructure
- Implement custom EEG processing layers using PyTorch primitives
- Use TorchScript for production model serialization
